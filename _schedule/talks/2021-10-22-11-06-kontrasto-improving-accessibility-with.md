This talk introduces [Kontrasto](https://kontrasto.netlify.app/), a library for Django and Wagtail that automatically improves the contrast of text over images. We’ll look into how it works, how accessibility guidelines define color contrast, and more generally where Django developers’ expertise can be used to improve accessibility.

Kontrasto is a dual client-side and server-side library, with both approaches bringing some benefits and drawbacks. If time allows, we’ll compare both approaches and think of the implications for performance and energy efficiency.
