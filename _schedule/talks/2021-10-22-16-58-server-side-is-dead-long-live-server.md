abstract: With no 'standard' approach to front-end other than built-in templating
  and so many JS front-end frameworks and tools and options, it's easy to get thrown
  for a loop. HTMX lets us stick to what django is good at - server-side stuff, mainly
  - without feeling like we're missing out on modern tools.

- bio: "Jack Linke tends to learn the hard way - and shares the lessons from those
    experiences with others through blogging, tweets, and speaking engagements. He
    has been developing software and hardware projects off-and-on for most of his
    life, but much of his relevant web development experience has been hard-earned
    over the past four years during development of [Watervize](https://www.watervize.com)
    - a B2B2B SaaS web application (written in Django) to help irrigation water utility
    companies improve efficiency, analysis, and communication with staff and agriculture
    customers.\r\n\r\nJack's technology interests include Python, the Django project,
    HTMX, GIS, graph theory, data storytelling, and visualization. He is a frequent
    contributor to the open source community and a contributing member of the Python
    Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nHis speaking experience includes briefing Generals
    on topics ranging from budgets to technical concepts, instructing at formal training
    centers, and providing software demonstrations and feature walk-throughs.\r\n\r\nOutside
    of coding, Jack solves unusual math and logic problems, and makes a mess in the
    kitchen."
