We are so excited to bring you a slice of the usual DjangoCon experience virtually! After not having a conference in 2020, we've done our best to try to prioritize sharing the best of the US Django Conference while remaining safe and accessible, and 100% online.

**Ways to Engage:**
- Youtube
- Discord
- Offline Biking and online competition with STRATA
- Recruitment Fair (Friday October 22nd 12:43 PM Central Time)
- Live DJ and Scheduled Tunes with DJ RanaRansom! (Lunch Break and End of Day, Friday and Saturday)
- Virtual Conference Hall with Spatial Chat

## Youtube
We have XX talks between XX - XX Friday, October 22nd and XX - XX Saturday, October 23rd 2021. All talks will be featured on Youtube, scheduled-released for the global community to enjoy together. Talks will be announced in Discord where you can join in on the discussion. We recommend subscribing to the [DjangoCon US Youtube Channel]() to have Youtube remind you while using the app or web client. You can check out the schedule [here]().

## Discord
Join the Discord!

## STRATA
Enjoy Biking? You're not alone. We have a big group of bikers in the Django/Python community. We're hoping you come out and use this Django-filled weekend, to keep up the activity. Join the [STRATA]()!

## Twitter
A large group of our community enjoys our conference in the TwitterSphere. @DjangoCon will be tweeting throughout the conference! Keep up to date as we'll be using our twitter handle as a way to communicate. Don't forget to tag us and use hashtag #DjangoConUS2021 to keep track of the conversation.
